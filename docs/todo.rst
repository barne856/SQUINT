TODO
====

- [ ] Optimize tensor math using SIMD for small vectors and matrices. E.g. 4x4 or less matmul, cross product, inv, det, etc.
- [ ] Optimize element access for vectors and matrices.
- [ ] Basic tensor expression templates for fused and chained operations, element-wise, scalar, and matrix operations
