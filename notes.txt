TODO: use multidimensional subscript operator to retrun value type when indexing to a scalar instead of tensor of shape 1
TODO: quantities should be templated instead of length and length_f use length<double> and length<float>
TODO: literal subscript are not needed - remove. e.g. _m, _yd, etc...

Math - Tensor Quantities (TQ)
	Units
	Linalg (Scalars, Vectors, Matrices)
Quntities
	util (functions, Constants, misc helper functions for math) everything else
	optimization (root finding, convex optimization, lagrange multipliers)
Hydraulics - Hydraulic Analysis Library (HAL)
	Network (links and nodes)
	Friction
	Shapes
	Headloss
	util (Dimensionless numbers, characteristic lengths)  everything else
Components (Fully connected networks) new module for each component
	Opening
	Passage
